"""Image processing module for OCR.

This module contains the necessary functions to process Image files of arbitrary
sizes before sending to the Vision API. It uses Google Vision API to detect the
text in a raster map, and send the textual results to the NLP API to identify
addresses and locations. The resulting entities are then consumed by the Google
Geocoding API to determine where the map is from.

The Vision API has a limit of 20 MB file size, and some of the maps reach up to
300 MB in size, causing requests timeouts. This module is a starting point to
optimize for this problem using recursion. The main function  takes in the image
and divide it into two parts each time, once horizontally and once vertically
until the 20 MB size limit is reached.
